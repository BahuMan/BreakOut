# BreakOut
started as a simple, single-level breakout clone for educationa purposes
Check the first commit to see how little is needed for a very basic game

Using Physics2D, and 3 scripts, I have enough for a simple bouncing ball, bricks, and a player paddle.

## Features:
* Multiple levels, each level contains name of next level (loops possible)
* Score (no high score yet)
* Some bricks drop bonuses
  * bonus to increase/decrease pad size
  * extra ball
  * sticky pad
